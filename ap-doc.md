## Guidelines

This document provides guidelines and examples for White House Web APIs, encouraging consistency, maintainability, and best practices across applications. White House APIs aim to balance a truly RESTful API interface with a positive developer experience (DX).

## RESTful URLs

### General guidelines for RESTful URLs
* A URL identifies a resource.
* URLs should include nouns, not verbs.
* Use plural nouns only for consistency (no singular nouns).
* Use HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to operate on the collections and elements.
* You shouldn’t need to go deeper than resource/identifier/resource.
* Put the version number at the base of your URL, for example http://example.com/v1/path/to/resource.
* URL v. header:
    * If it changes the logic you write to handle the response, put it in the URL.
    * If it doesn’t change the logic for each response, like OAuth info, put it in the header.
* Specify optional fields in a comma separated list.
* Formats should be in the form of api/v2/resource/{id}.json


## HTTP Verbs

HTTP verbs, or methods, should be used in compliance with their definitions under the [HTTP/1.1](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) standard.
The action taken on the representation will be contextual to the media type being worked on and its current state. Here's an example of how HTTP verbs map to create, read, update, delete operations in a particular context:

| HTTP METHOD | POST            | GET       | PUT         | DELETE |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| CRUD OP     | CREATE          | READ      | UPDATE      | DELETE |
| /dogs       | Create new dogs | List dogs | Bulk update | Delete all dogs |
| /dogs/1234  | Error           | Show Bo   | If exists, update Bo; If not, error | Delete Bo |

(Example from Web API Design, by Brian Mulloy, Apigee.)


## Responses

* No values in keys
* No internal-specific names (e.g. "node" and "taxonomy term")
* Metadata should only contain direct properties of the response set, not properties of the members of the response set

### Good examples

No values in keys:

    "tags": [
      {"id": "125", "name": "Environment"},
      {"id": "834", "name": "Water Quality"}
    ],


### Bad examples

Values in keys:

    "tags": [
      {"125": "Environment"},
      {"834": "Water Quality"}
    ],


## Error handling

Error responses should include a common HTTP status code, message for the developer, message for the end-user (when appropriate), internal error code (corresponding to some specific internally determined ID), links where developers can find more info. For example:

    {
      "status" : 400,
      "developerMessage" : "Verbose, plain language description of the problem. Provide developers
       suggestions about how to solve their problems here",
      "userMessage" : "This is a message that can be passed along to end-users, if needed.",
      "errorCode" : "444444",
      "moreInfo" : "http://www.example.gov/developer/path/to/help/for/444444,
       http://drupal.org/node/444444",
    }

Use three simple, common response codes indicating (1) success, (2) failure due to client-side problem, (3) failure due to server-side problem:
* 200 - OK
* 400 - Bad Request
* 500 - Internal Server Error



## Request & Response Examples

        "created": "1231621302"
    }






## JSONP

JSONP is easiest explained with an example. Here's one from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2067472/what-is-jsonp-all-about?answertab=votes#tab-top):

> Say you're on domain abc.com, and you want to make a request to domain xyz.com. To do so, you need to cross domain boundaries, a no-no in most of browserland.

> The one item that bypasses this limitation is `<script>` tags. When you use a script tag, the domain limitation is ignored, but under normal circumstances, you can't really DO anything with the results, the script just gets evaluated.

> Enter JSONP. When you make your request to a server that is JSONP enabled, you pass a special parameter that tells the server a little bit about your page. That way, the server is able to nicely wrap up its response in a way that your page can handle.

> For example, say the server expects a parameter called "callback" to enable its JSONP capabilities. Then your request would look like:

>         http://www.xyz.com/sample.aspx?callback=mycallback

> Without JSONP, this might return some basic javascript object, like so:

>         { foo: 'bar' }

> However, with JSONP, when the server receives the "callback" parameter, it wraps up the result a little differently, returning something like this:

>         mycallback({ foo: 'bar' });

> As you can see, it will now invoke the method you specified. So, in your page, you define the callback function:

>         mycallback = function(data){
>             alert(data.foo);
>         };
